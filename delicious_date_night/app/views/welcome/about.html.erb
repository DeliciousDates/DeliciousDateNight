    <p>"My husband and I were so excited when we heard about this new double dating website. We're new in the area and were having a hard time meeting other couples to hang out with. Delicious Date Night solved that problem by opening up a world of social opportunities that we never would have found on our own. We discovered great neighborhood gems from our dating partners and have made new friends for life. Thank you Delicious Date Night!!"

    <p>"As a couple in our eighties, my wife and I had given up on the idea of making new friends. Where would we find new friends at our age? Then our grandson told us about Delicious Date Night. Being computer savvy, my wife signed us up and the next week we met our new friends Betsy and Wilma. This website is just wonderful and we'll be telling everyone in our retirement village about it."
