# Delicious Date Night

### **Delicious Date Night** is an application that helps couples answer that ever-contentious question, *"What do you wanna do tonight?"*

With **Delicious Date Night**, users can:

- Sign up and log in as a couple
- Create a profile that hosts their unique information
- Create unique themed date nights, based on their personal preferences
- Find other couples to invite on their themed dates
- Couples can update the details of or cancel a date
- Browse dates created by other users and add these events to their favorites

** Delicious Date Night utilizes the following technologies and languages:**

- *Ruby on Rails*: a super back-end language plus the sweetest library around; it works seamlessly with ActiveRecord and a postgresql database
- *JavaScript and jQuery*: a front-end language that puts the FUN in 'functional user interaction'
- *SendGrid*: an API that allows applications to send customized emails to users
- *Paperclip*: a library that lets users upload images to the application
